## Bracket usage
Self-explainatory
```Cpp
if (/* condition */) {
  /* code stuff */
} else {
  /* code stuff */
}
```

## Conditionals
There should be no spaces at the beginning or end of conditionals

`if ( /* condition */)` ← bad

`if (/* condition */ )` ← bad

`if(/* condition */)` ← okay, not prefered

`if (/* condition */)` ← good
